A month that was intense, demanding, and incredibly rewarding — both **technically** and **personally**.

## 🌊 What is the Piscine?
The Piscine is the **entry bootcamp** for 42.  
For 4 weeks, participants dive into a peer-to-peer learning environment with no teachers and no formal classes:  
learning by doing, constant problem solving, and teamwork.

## 🖥️ Projects I worked on
During the Piscine, I completed several exercises and projects in **C** and **Shell**:

- **Shell00 → Shell01**: basic UNIX commands, shell usage, file permissions.  
- **C00 → C07**: fundamentals of the C language (functions, loops, pointers, strings, memory).  
- **Rushes**: group projects built in 48 hours (teamwork, Git, problem-solving under pressure).  
- **Exam Rank 00 to 02**: timed practical exams, solved entirely without external help.

## 🤝 What I learned
- **Rigor**: even the smallest syntax or logic error has consequences.  
- **Autonomy**: researching, reading documentation, and figuring things out independently.  
- **Collaboration**: peer-to-peer learning, code reviews, teamwork.  
- **Resilience**: late nights, stubborn bugs… and the joy when it finally compiles.

## 🧭 Personal takeaway
